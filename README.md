**Automate-boring-stuff-python** is a repository dedicated to **documenting my learning process** in **Python**, based on the book *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* by Al Sweigart.

The main goal is to **build a solid foundation in Python** through the study of the book and hands-on practice, with the long-term objective of applying this knowledge to develop a **Data Science–oriented profile**.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository is intended **for educational and personal learning purposes only**.

The content, exercises, and projects are based on the book *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*, **but they are NOT intended to replace, distribute, or substitute the original material**.

Anyone interested in learning Python is **strongly encouraged to study directly from the book**, in order to benefit from the detailed explanations and examples provided by the author.
